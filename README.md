# RAG WITH LLAMA2
This repo is demonstrate an RAG technique which is used for providing some external datas for specific domains to the LLM's. With RAG technique you can get completion by providing some external data(documents etc.) So even if the model don't know the answer , can provide a completion according to the provided data.If you don't have enough data for fine-tuning RAG is good choice. Some technologies i used in this project.

* Huggingface (For getting Llama2 model)
* Langchain (For the using model effectively)
* Pinecone (VectorDB for documents)
* FastAPI (For creating api which faciliate access to the model.)
* Embedding Model (For the convert our chunks to the vectors)

  And more , if you want to see detailly you can examine the ipynb file.
